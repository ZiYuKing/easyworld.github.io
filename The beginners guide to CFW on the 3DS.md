For everyone new in the 3DS Scene and wondering what a CFW is or which CFWs exist. Then how to use CFW, this beginners Guide to custom firmware is for you. (You other guys can take a look at this too :P)

A CFW is also called “Custom Firmware”. It is a modified Firmware for your Device that uses the Official Firmware as a base. It allows you to use applications that aren’t allowed by the producer (Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft).

Yes this also means Piracy can be acchieved with CFWs -_-
